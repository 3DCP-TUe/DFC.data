## Softare package structure

Each software package includes four standard folders:

- scripts: Contains template files for processing the acquired data.
- database template: Stores the raw data and metadata generated by the software packages.
- src: Contains the source code for data acquisition (the main program).
- utils: Includes support materials, such as figures for the README, etc.
