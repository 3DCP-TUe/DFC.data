# System Components

## Metadata File

Each system component is described using a dedicated metadata file. This file is written in a structured YAML format that is both human- and machine-readable, making it easy to maintain and integrate. The metadata file captures all relevant details about the component and is organized into the following sections:

- **attributes**: A short description of what the component is and its main function.
- **dimensions**: Physical properties such as volume, which are important for linking processing data to material evolution.
- **couplings**: Lists the inlets and outlets of the component. This helps check compatibility with other components in the system.
- **input/output (I/O)**: Describes the analog or digital interfaces of the component, including signal properties. This ensures accurate calculation of process values from recorded signals.
- **sensors**: Details any measurement devices integrated into or attached to the component. Includes name, type, manufacturer, model, and product number.
- **processed system data**: Lists the process parameters that are logged, including their name, function, unit, and the corresponding header in the log file. This allows for automated data processing.
- **parts**: If the component consists of multiple elements (excluding sensors), they are listed here. 
- **compatible with**: Only for inserts, specifies in which component this insert can be placed.

To add a new component, browse the [system components library](/src/libraries/system_components) for similar components. Use them as a reference to fill in the metadata file and structure any related files.

> **Note:**  
> When adding a component from the library to your data records, always verify that its settings match those described in your metadata file. This is especially important for:
> - **Coriolis sensors**: Settings and signal conversions can be changed.
> - **Dosing systems**: Calibration curves (e.g., motor frequency vs. flow rate) depend on the material being fed.

## Library

The [system components library](/src/libraries/system_components) is organized into categories such as conduits, material delivery systems, motion systems, printheads, and sensors. Some of these categories contain subcategoriesâ€”for example, the material delivery systems and printheads classes include inserts, which contain components like mixing blades and dosing screws that can be placed inside other system components. The complete categorization can be foind below. 

```
class: conduit
class: material delivery systems
    main object: material delivery plc
    subclass: dosing systems
    subclass: inserts
    subclass: mixer pumps
    subclass: mixers
    subclass: pumps
    subclass: silos/storage
class: motion systems
class: printheads
    main object: printhead plc
    subclass: inserts
    subclass: nozzles
    subclass: static
    subclass: dynamic
class: sensors
```

### Naming convention

System components follow a structured naming format based on the inlet and outlets of the component to make identification and compatibility easier. Here are some examples:

```
mc25f   Mortar coupling, 25 mm, female          (options: 25, 35, 50, female, male)
mc35m   Mortar coupling, 35 mm, male            (options: 25, 35, 50, female, male)
fl40    Flange DN40                             (options: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 32, 40, etc.)
tc93    Tri-clamp flange diameter 93 mm         (options: 25, 51, 64, 78, 91, 119, etc.)
pi6     Push-in fitting 6 mm outer diameter     (options: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc.)
so42    Slip-on 42 mm outer diameter
geka    GEKA coupling
pfd     Pressure flange for D-pump              (options: A, B, C, D, R, T, L-pump)
sfr     Suction flange for R-pump               (options: A, B, C, D, R, T, L-pump)
```

The general format is: 

```
COUPLING_IN-COUPLING_OUT-DIAMETER-OPTIONAL_DIAMETER_2-CUSTOM_PROPERTY-ID_NUMBER`. 
```
 
Examples:

```
hose mc35f-mc35m-d35-l5000-1
reducer tc93-tc64-d73-d50-1
elbow mc35f-mc35m-d35-a90-1
adapter fl40-mc35m-d35-1
coriolis sensor fl40-fl40-d35-1
pressure sensor mc35f-mc35m-d35-25bar-1
pressure sensor mc35f-mc35m-d35-25bar-2
pressure sensor mc35f-mc35m-d35-10bar-1
```
