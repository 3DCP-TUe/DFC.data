# Compression test

## Description of the experiment

Compression tests are performed by placing a cylindrical specimen in a hydraulic press and measuring it's resistance according to EN 12390-3.

## Data collection

The maximum resistance is manually recorded in a csv file that follows the structure described below.

## Processed data file format

The `processed_data` folder contains at least the following files:

**`overview.csv`**
