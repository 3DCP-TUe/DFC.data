[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

## Introduction 

This repository contains the template and setup information library for the 3D Sneak Peek database. The aim of this project is to collect experimental data about 3D concrete printing in a structured way and distribute this data to the community. This repository includes the system library of the equipment at TU/e and the templates for data records and software packages.

## Documentation

In the following README, the structure and more detailed information of the various parts of this project are provided. 

- [Data record](docs/data_record.md)
- Process measurements
    - [Setupinfo](setupinfo.md)
- [Offline measurements](offline_measurements.md)
- [Software structure](software.md)

## Version numbering

The 3D Sneak Peak project uses the following versioning scheme: 

```
0.x.x ---> MAJOR version: Incompatible changes; for example, restructuring the database format and metadata files.
x.0.x ---> MINOR version: Functionality added in a backward-compatible manner; for example, new system components.
x.x.0 ---> PATCH version: Small backward-compatible changes; for example, small corrections in a component property.
```

## Open science statement

We are committed to the principles of open science to ensure that our work can be reproduced and built upon by others. Our approach includes the following key points:

- Reproducibility: We strive to make our work reproducible by sharing detailed methodologies and data.
- Unique Resources and Data: We have equipment and facilities that are not available at other institutes. We generate data that other institutes cannot produce, and we share this data openly.
- Data and Software Sharing: We share our data and software and encourage others to do the same. If others use our data and software, they must also share their software and data under similar terms.

To support these principles, we license our software under the General Public License version 3 or later (free to use, with attribution, share with source code) and our data and documentation under CC BY-SA (free to use, with attribution, share-alike). By adhering to these principles, we aim to encourage an open and collaborative scientific community. We expect that if you use our resources, you will do the same.
