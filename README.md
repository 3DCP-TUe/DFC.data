# 3D Sneak Peek: 3DCP Database

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

## Introduction 
This repository contains the template and setup information library for the 3D Sneak Peek database. The aim of this project is to collect experimental data about 3D concrete printing in a structured way and distribute this data to the community. This repository includes the system library of the equipment at TU/e and the templates for data records and software packages.

|   |   +-- node-red-3dseep
|   |   +-- ...
|   +-- setupinfo
|   +-- metadata_record.yml
```

The analysis folders are meant to provide quick insights into the data. For example, time series plots of viscocity and pressure readings. 

### Setup info structure

#### Folder structure

```
class: conduit
class: material delivery systems
    main object: material delivery plc
    subclass: dosing systems
    subclass: inserts
    subclass: mixer pumps
    subclass: pumps
    subclass: silos/storage
class: motion systems
class: printheads
    main object: printhead plc
    subclass: inserts
    subclass: nozzles
    subclass: static
    subclass: dynamic
class: sensors
```

Inserts are components that are placed inside other components. Examples include feeding screws used in dosing systems and mixing blades.

#### Component folder structure

```
+-- component
|   +-- name

|   |   |   +-- ...
|   |   +-- metadata.yml
|   |   +-- name.stl
|   |   +-- name.jpg
|   |   +-- ...
```
