[**#1 - Data from tracer experiments under varying flow rates in a 3D concrete printing system**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17191645)

This dataset contains measurements collected from tracer experiments conducted on a 3D concrete printing system. It includes the residence time distributions (RTD) obtained under varying flow rates, as well as continuously measured mass flow rate throughout the session. Additionally, the dataset includes data from in-line process measurements, such as pressure, temperature, and other relevant operational parameters.
